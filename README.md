### üß™ Hands-On Lab: Build & Test a RESTful API in .NET with Copilot-Aided Unit Testing

#### üè∑Ô∏è Lab Title
Build, Test, and Serve a ProductService API with Static UI, GitHub Copilot, and Bogus Test Data

#### üéØ Lab Objective
Create a .NET 6 Web API project that exposes endpoints for managing products. Use GitHub Copilot to generate unit tests with edge-case data using Bogus. Add a simple `index.html` UI and serve it alongside the API. Run and validate all components locally.

#### ‚úÖ Lab Scenario
A developer is building a backend ProductService for an e-commerce platform. The app exposes REST endpoints for CRUD operations. The team wants to enforce automated testing from day one and leverage Copilot for increased productivity and quality.

### üîß Lab Steps Overview

| Setup Step | Description                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1          | Scaffold project using `dotnet new webapi` |
| 2          | Add `Product` model and `ProductService` logic |
| 3          | Add API controller with 3 routes: get all, get by ID, add product |
| 4          | Create a static `index.html` file for local testing |
| 5          | Enable serving static files in `Program.cs` |

| Test Step | Description                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Create `ProductService.Tests` with xUnit |
| 2         | Install and use `Bogus` for fake data    |
| 3         | Use Copilot to generate tests for all methods |
| 4         | Add prompts for edge cases (invalid price, empty name) |
| 5         | Run tests locally and verify via Swagger/UI |

| Expected Outcome | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1                | REST API exposes 3 working endpoints             |
| 2                | index.html allows live testing via fetch() calls |
| 3                | Unit tests exist and cover normal + edge cases   |
| 4                | Copilot correctly scaffolds tests based on comments |
| 5                | Developer understands when to override Copilot  |

### üöÄ Instructor Demo: PlayerApp ‚Äì Spring Boot API with Copilot + GitHub Actions

#### üè∑Ô∏è Demo Title
Build, Test, and Deploy a Java Spring Boot API Using GitHub Copilot and Azure App Service

#### üéØ Demo Objective
Use GitHub Copilot to build a Java-based Player API (Player ID, name, random score), generate unit tests with Java Faker, create CI/CD pipelines via Copilot prompts, and deploy to Azure App Service.

#### ‚úÖ Demo Scenario
The instructor demonstrates how Copilot can serve as a real-time assistant to write Java code, generate test coverage, and scaffold deployment workflows.

### üîß Demo Steps Overview

| Phase        | Description                                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Init | Use Spring Initializr to scaffold a Maven-based Spring Boot project  |
| API Logic    | Create Player model, service, and controller using Copilot prompts   |
| Unit Tests   | Use Copilot to generate JUnit tests + Java Faker for test data       |
| CI Pipeline  | Copilot-generated GitHub Actions YAML for build/test with Maven      |
| CD Pipeline  | Copilot-generated GitHub Actions YAML for deploying to Azure         |
| Deployment   | Deploy to Azure App Service using GitHub Secrets + publish profile   |
| Validation   | Call endpoints via browser/Postman to validate full flow             |

| Expected Outcome | Description                                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                | Fully working Player API deployed to Azure                      |
| 2                | API returns mock data with scores between 0‚Äì10                 |
| 3                | Tests are Copilot-generated and pass locally + in GitHub CI     |
| 4                | CI/CD workflows are Copilot-assisted and reusable               |
| 5                | Demonstrates real-time Copilot productivity in Java development |
